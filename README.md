# deep_learning_notes
These notes are my personal learning notes from Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Notes and Homework.

As we know, in the lecture, Tensorflow 1.0 and Keras are deployed. But now both of them are out-dated. Here I revised these codes
into tensorflow 2.0 framework.

I also uploaded more learning materias about the applications for deep learning.

The note can be devided into 2 parts:

1. knowledge parts: the code numbering by x.1 is knowledge points.
2. practice parts: codes numbering by x.2 to x.n is practice based on knowledge.

Hope these are helpful.
